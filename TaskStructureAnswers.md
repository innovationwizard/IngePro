Perfect! I understand this is the **CORE FUNCTION** of the app. Let me ask the necessary questions to design the task management system correctly:

## **Task Structure Questions**

### **1. Task Categories & Units**
- Are task categories predefined (like "Sello de juntas") or can they be created dynamically?

Tasks categories and specific tasks are created and updated dynamically by Admin users.

- For each task category, do you need:
  - **Progress unit** (e.g., linear meters for "Sello de juntas")

Yes, when an Admin creates a specific task, he needs to input what the progress unit is. 

  - **Consumption unit** (e.g., cubic centimeters for "Sello de juntas")

Yes, when an Admin creates a specific task, he needs to input the complete list of materials required for the specific task. 

  - **Loss unit** (same as consumption or different?)

Loss unit is always the same as consumption unit.
For example, if bricks are used and one brick is broken, that broken brick is registered as material loss. 
For example, if one bottle of adhesive is opened, and only half of the adhesive is used, but the adhesive that remains in the bottle can't be kept and used for another project because it hardens after the bottle is first opened, that half bottle is registered as material loss.


### **2. Task Assignment & Hierarchy**
- Can a task be assigned to:
  - Individual workers?

  Yes.

  - Teams?

  Yes. 

  - Multiple workers simultaneously?

  Yes.

- Do tasks have dependencies (Task A must be completed before Task B)?

In reality, they do. But dependencies is out of scope for this app. 

- Can tasks be subdivided into smaller tasks?

Not for now. Let's not subdivide tasks for now. 
But let's leave a field for additional attributes. 
For example, if Worker needs to paint room A and room B,
The specific task is pain, not subdivided. 
But Worker should be able to log: Right now I'm doing this task in room A. Now I'm doing the same specific task but in room B. 

### **3. Progress Tracking**
- How is progress updated? 
  - Real-time input by workers?

Yes: progress is updated in real time by workers.
IN THE FUTURE we will add photos in the updates by the workers. Please build the structure ready for that. 

  - Supervisor validation required?

Yes: each work update requires validation from Supervisor. 
Logs are created and visible from the moment the worker creates the update. 
The only thing that changes is the label: Not yet validated -> Validated by <Name of Supervisor>.

- Automatic calculation based on time worked?

We do track time. 
Time worked is used as a denominator to calculate productivity.

- Can progress be negative (work undone/redone)?

No. Progress cannot be negative. 

- Do you need progress history (who updated what when)?

Yes, we need progress history.
We need two versions of progress history. 
Admin users need a complete version for accountability. 
Supervisor users need a "public" version with times but without names. This public version is used as invoice, both for partial payments and for final payment when the project is complete. 

### **4. Material Tracking**
- Are materials:
  - Assigned to specific tasks?

Materials are assigned to specific projects. 

  - Available at project level?

Materials are available at project level.

  - Consumed automatically or manually logged?

Material consumption is a required field when a worker logs progress. 

- How do you track material loss vs. consumption?

Material loss is a required field when a worker logs progress.

- Do you need material inventory levels?

Yes. It is very helpful for Supervisors and Admins to know how much inventory is left at the project. It is not uncommon that Workers are idle because they don't have what they need. 

### **5. Real-time Updates**
- How should real-time updates work?
  - WebSocket connections?

No. WebSocket is too much. 

  - Polling?

Polling sounds about right. Even once per hour would be better than the current system. 

  - Push notifications?

No need for push notifications. 

- Who needs to see real-time updates?
  - Workers on the same task?

Yes. Workers need feedback. They need to see what they logged as reassurance. 

  - Supervisors?

Yes. Admins and Supervisors need to see if everything is progressing as expected or if they need to intervene. 

  - Project managers?

We don't have Project managers. Supervisors are in charge of projects. 

### **6. Task States**
- What are the possible task states?
  - Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Paused, Cancelled?
  - Any other states specific to construction?

The possible task states are: 
1. Not Started
2. In Progress
3. Completed
4. Obstacle, waiting for permit
5. Obstacle, waiting for decision
6. Obstacle, waiting for inspection
7. Obstacle, waiting for materials
8. Obstacle, waiting for equipment
9. Obstacle, waiting for weather
10. Obstacle, waiting for OTHER


### **7. Reporting & Analytics**
- What reports do you need?

Reports need to be able to be filtered: 
- Per company
- Per project
- Per worker
- Per task category
- Per specific task

  - Progress by task/project?

Yes, we need to display progress

  - Material consumption vs. budget?

We don't always have a budget. 
We need to display material consumption and material loss. 

  - Worker productivity?

Yes. We need to display worker productivity.

  - Time tracking per task?

Yes. We need to be able to see time and productivity per task category, and per specific task.

### **8. Integration with Existing System**
- Should tasks integrate with the existing WorkLog system?

We can make any changes and modifications to the database schema so that the task management system functions like clockwork. Remember that THIS is the CORE FUNCTION of the app. Everything else is built to sustain THIS. 

- How should clock in/out relate to task progress?

Clock in and out is not related to task progress. 
It's an independent measure of worker punctuality. 

- Should location tracking be task-specific?

Location tracking is not related to task progress. 
It's an independent measure of worker attendance.
We don't need to track the worker all the time. 
We need him to share his location when he clocks in, when he clocks out, and on-demand per Supervisor request via phone call. 

Please answer these questions so I can design the database schema and API structure correctly for your construction industry needs.
